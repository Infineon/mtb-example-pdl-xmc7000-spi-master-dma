# XMC7000 MCU: SCB SPI master with DMA

This example demonstrates the use of the SPI serial communication block (SCB) resource for Infineon MCU in master and slave mode using DMA. The SPI master is configured to send command packets to control a user LED on the slave. Both the master and slave can be on the same device or on different devices.

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example will clone the "[mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-spi-master-dma](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-spi-master-dma)" application with the desired name "PdlScbMasterDma" configured for the *KIT-XMC72-EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-spi-master-dma --user-app-name PdlScbMasterDma --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>


> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Configure the value of the `SPI_MODE` macro in *interface.h* to `SPI_MODE_BOTH` (only for kits with two SPI ports).

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe that the kit LED blinks at 1 Hz.


## Configuring a kit with two SPI ports in both master and slave mode

By default, the kit is configured to work in both-master-and-slave mode (ensure that the `SPI_MODE` macro in *interface.h* is configured as `SPI_MODE_BOTH`).

Do the following to configure the kit to work in both-master-and-slave mode:

1. Run the [Device configurator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig) tool from the Quick Panel of the IDE.

   Because the kit has only one available SPI port, by default, the associated SCB is aliased as *mSPI* in the **Peripherals** tab.

2. Rename the associated SCBs to **sSPI and mSPI** and configure the SCBs:

   **Figure 1. Configure peripherals master SPI**

   ![](images/configure_peripherals_spi_master.jpg)
   
   **Figure 2. Configure peripherals slave SPI**

   ![](images/configure_peripherals_spi_slave.jpg)


3. In the **Pins** tab, assign the correct drive mode to SPI pins in the **Drive Mode** drop-down menu:

   **Table 1. Drive mode for Slave SPI pins**

    SPI pins | Drive mode
    :--------| ------------
    MOSI     | Digital High-Z. Input buffer ON
    MISO     | Strong Drive. Input buffer OFF
    SCLK     | Digital High-Z. Input buffer ON
    SS0      | Digital High-Z. Input buffer ON
	
	**Table 2. Drive mode for Master SPI pins**
    SPI pins | Drive mode
    :--------| ------------
    MOSI     | Strong Drive. Input buffer OFF
    MISO     | Digital High-Z. Input buffer ON
    SCLK     | Strong Drive. Input buffer OFF
    SS0      | Strong Drive. Input buffer OFF

4. In the **DMA** tab, rename the DMA to **txDma and rxDma** and configure it:

   **Figure 3. Configure txDMA**

   ![](images/configure_tx_dma.jpg)
   
   **Figure 4. Configure rxDMA**

   ![](images/configure_rx_dma.jpg)

5. Select **File** > **Save** to save the changes and generate the configuration files.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the debugging CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.
